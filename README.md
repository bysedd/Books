Books: create a Python class defines methods for creating book records.
Each record should include generated book ID, title, author,
year, publisher, number of enabled copies, and publication date.
Implement separate methods to set each attribute of the book, such as title,
author, year, publisher, number of enabled copies, and publication date.
Additionally, include methods to retrieve each attribute of the book, including title,
author, year, publisher, number of copies, number of enabled copies, and publication date.
Make sure to incorporate error checking, such as exception handling, throughout the class.
Give appropriate comments for documentation purposes.

BookList:
develop a Python class provides methods for managing a collection of book objects created from the Book class.
Construct a constructor to create a new instance of this class.
Design a method to store the collection of book instances using a data structure, such as a dictionary.
Implement a method that allows searching through the collection to find a book based on title,
author, publisher, or publication date.
Create a method for removing a book from the collection, specifying the title of the book as the parameter.
Additionally, include a method to return the total number of books stored in the collection.
Incorporate error checking, such as exception handling, into the class.
Include comments to document the capability of the class.

Users: create a Python class with functions for creating user objects.
Define a constructor to initialize a user with attributes such as username, first name,
surname, house number, street name, zip code, email address, and date of birth.
Implement separate methods to retrieve each attribute of the user, including username,
first name, surname, house number, street name, zip code, email address, and date of birth.
Similarly, create methods to edit the attributes of the user,
such as first name, surname, email address, and date of birth.
Ensure that appropriate error checking is included.
Comment the class to give clear documentation.

UserList:
design a Python class facilitates the management of user's objects collections created using the Users class.
Construct a constructor to create a new instance of this class.
Implement a method to store the collection of user instances using a suitable data structure, such as a dictionary.
Create a method for removing a user from the collection based on their first name.
This method should tell the program users if there are many users with the same first name.
Additionally, include a method to count the number of users in the system,
which can be determined by the number of user objects in the collection.
Develop a method to retrieve a user's details based on their username.
Include error checking in the class, such as exception handling.
Give comments to document the capability of the class.

Loans: craft a Python class for managing book loans.
Construct a constructor to create a new instance of this class.
Implement a method that allows a user to borrow a book.
This method should include an appropriate mechanism for assigning a book to a user.
Store this information in a suitable data structure for further processing.
Create a method for a user to return a book, which involves unassigning a before assigned book.
Develop a method that counts and returns the total number of books a user is now borrowing.
Additionally, include a method to print all the overdue books, along with the user's username and first name.
Retrieve the username and first name of the user using the appropriate methods defined in the User class.
Include error checking, such as exception handling, within the class.
Give comments to document the capability of the class.
